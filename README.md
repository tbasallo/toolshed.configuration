Configuration helpers for x.config files

[Toolshed](https://github.com/tbasallo/toolshed)

This was part of the original Toolshed but removed because configuration is a different beast in .Net Standard and Core.
Seeing as Core has a much better way of passing config information around, this has been separated out (but not deprecated).
But, like most tools in the shed, it's handy when working with configuration files.
