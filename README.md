# toolshed.configuration
Configuration helpers for x.config files

This was part of the original Toolshed but removed because configuration is a different beast in .Net Standard and Core.
Seeing as Core has a much better way of passing config information around, this has been separated out.
But, like most tools in the shed, it's handy when working with configuration files.
